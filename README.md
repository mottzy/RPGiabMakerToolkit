# RPGiabMakerToolkit
A toolkit of scripts to help speed up development using RPG-in-a-box.

# Installing

This requires [RPG-in-a-box](https://rpginabox.com). This is a full project that can be opened and
used directly. Assets can be copy/pasted into your own RPGiab projects for use. Suggested that
all scripts prefixed with "rmt" be copied over if doing so.
